*Markovian Embedding of Nonlinear Memory via Spectral Representation * ([10.1016/j.cnsns.2025.109540](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cnsns.2025.109540))

Description: There are two sets of Matlab codes, each one corresponding to the different prototypical models discussed in Section 3 of the article. There are three pieces of codes for the Walking droplet problem (Section 3.1 in the article); further identfied by "swd" in the filename, the main one being swd_main.m. The rest pertain to the 1D Stefan problem. 

Usage: The python script requires the standard scientific packages (NumPy + SciPy), image processing library (scikit-image) and the plotting library (Matplotlib).
