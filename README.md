"Markovian Embedding of Nonlinear Memory via Spectral Representation" ([10.1016/j.cnsns.2025.109540](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cnsns.2025.109540))

Description: There are two sets of Matlab codes, each one corresponding to the different prototypical models discussed in Section 3 of the article. There are three pieces of codes+functions for the Walking droplet problem (Section 3.1 in the article); further identfied by "swd" in the filename, the main one being swd_markovian.m. The rest (8) pertain to the 1D Stefan problem (Section 3.2), with the main one titled stefan_main.m. 

Usage: Ensure the two sets have all their dependent function modules.
