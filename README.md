"Markovian Embedding of Nonlinear Memory via Spectral Representation" ([10.1016/j.cnsns.2025.109540](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cnsns.2025.109540))

Description: There are two sets of MATLAB codes, each corresponding to one of the two prototypical models discussed in Section 3 of the article. For the walking‑droplet problem (Section 3.1), there are three code files whose names include “swd,” with swd_markovian.m serving as the main script. For the 1D Stefan problem (Section 3.2), there are eight files, with stefan_main.m as the primary script.

Usage: Ensure each set has all its dependent function modules while running.
